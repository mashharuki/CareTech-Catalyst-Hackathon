# Project Overview
- Name: CareTech-Catalyst-Hackathon
- Repository type: pnpm monorepo (`pnpm-workspace.yaml` with `pkgs/*`).
- Main packages:
  - `pkgs/contract`: Compact contract source (`src/counter.compact`) and TS runtime/test harness.
  - `pkgs/cli`: Midnight interaction/deploy/test utilities (testnet/standalone/proof-server related scripts).
  - `pkgs/frontend`: Vite + React 19 frontend.
- Tooling baseline:
  - Root formatter: Biome (`biome.json`, `pnpm run format`).
  - Package-level lint/test/build are managed per package (`eslint`, `vitest`, `tsc`, `vite`).
- Agent/skill assets:
  - Both `.agents/skills` and `.codex/skills` exist and are mostly mirrored.
  - Includes `midnight-compact-app-builder`, `frontend-design`, `vercel-react-best-practices`, `web-design-guidelines`, `skill-creator`, `docs-check`.
- Process docs:
  - `AGENTS.md` defines Japanese response policy and Kiro spec-driven workflow expectations.
  - `.kiro/settings` exists, but `.kiro/steering` and `.kiro/specs` are currently empty (no active spec files yet).
