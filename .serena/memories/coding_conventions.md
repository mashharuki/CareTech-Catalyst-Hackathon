# Coding Conventions
- Monorepo management: `pnpm` workspace (`pkgs/*`).
- Root formatting is Biome-driven (`pnpm run format`, configured in `biome.json`).
- Package style/tooling:
  - TypeScript + ESM across `cli`, `contract`, `frontend`.
  - Linting primarily via `eslint` in each package.
  - Testing via `vitest` (`cli`, `contract`).
  - Frontend uses Vite + React 19.
- Workflow and communication constraints from `AGENTS.md`:
  - Think in English, respond in Japanese.
  - Follow spec-driven development flow (requirements -> design -> tasks -> implementation).
  - Prefer safe, non-destructive git operations; avoid silent error suppression.
  - Maintain security/quality/testing discipline (input validation, explicit error handling, test coverage for behavior).
