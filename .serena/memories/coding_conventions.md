# Coding Conventions
- Formatting/linting managed by Biome (`biome.json`).
- Formatter uses spaces and JavaScript double quotes.
- Keep files concise and focused; repository heavily uses markdown-based skill definitions.
- Follow AGENTS.md guidance: respond in Japanese, think in English, maintain quality/security/testing discipline, and avoid destructive git actions.
